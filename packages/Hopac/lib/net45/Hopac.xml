 An experimental interface for asynchronously disposable resources.  See

<summary>
 A type that has no public constructors to indicate that a job or function
 does not return normally.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Hopac.Scheduler.Create.TopLevelHandler">
<summary>
 Specifies the top level exception handler job constructor of the
 scheduler.  When a job fails with an otherwise unhandled exception,
 the job is killed and a new job is constructed with the top level
 handler constructor and then started.  To avoid infinite loops, in
 case the top level handler job raises exceptions, it is simply killed
 after printing a message to the console.  The default top level
 handler simply prints out a message to the console.

 Number of worker threads.  Using more than

 `Environment.ProcessorCount`.

 Specifies the maximum stack size for worker threads.  The default
 is to use the default maximum stack size of the `Thread` class.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Hopac.Scheduler.Create.IdleHandler">
<summary>
 Specifies the idle handler for workers.  The worker idle handler is
 run whenever an individual worker runs out of work.  The idle handler
 must return an integer value that specifies how many milliseconds the
 worker is allowed to sleep.  `Timeout.Infinite` puts the worker into
 sleep until the scheduler explicitly wakes it up.  `0` means that the
 idle handler found some new work and the worker should immediately
 look for it.
</summary>
</member>
<member name="P:Hopac.Scheduler.Create.Foreground">
<summary>
 Specifies whether worker threads are run as background threads or as
 foreground threads.  The default is to run workers as background
 threads.  If you want to run worker threads as foreground threads,
 then you will have to explicitly kill the worker threads.  Using
 foreground threads is probably preferable if your application
 dynamically creates and kills local schedulers to make sure the
 worker threads are properly killed.

 Starts running the given job, but does not wait for the job to finish.
 Upon the failure or success of the job, one of the given actions is called
 once.  See also: `abort`.
